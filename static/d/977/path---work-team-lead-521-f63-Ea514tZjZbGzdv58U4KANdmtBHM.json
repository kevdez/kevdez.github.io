I was just recognized last week by my old manager during a large meeting about how I’ve been leading this new team.</p>\n<p>So far, my team consists of 2 other guys. One guy came from startups, in  finance, who learned how to program with the help of bootcamps. The other guy was previously an elementary school teacher, who also went through a bootcamp. This is his first job as a Software Engineer.</p>\n<p>As the “veteran” of the company, I know the ins and outs of the services we use, and the architecture needed to deploy an application. </p>\n<p>Our application is kind of public-facing (I’m not sure yet, because it’s still being developed). It’s to help third party vendors and suppliers that are trying to sell their product on online or in stores. Currently, the process to onboard these people and their product is time-consuming, email-centric, and not very efficient.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"Kevin","categories":["#work","#management","#programming","#people"],"date":"April 23, 2019 02:03","path":"/work/team-lead","title":"On being a team lead"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/work/team-lead/"}}
