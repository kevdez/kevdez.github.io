{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>Being a team lead has felt refreshing. I was recognized last week by my old manager during a large meeting about how I’ve been leading this new team. I guess I’ve been doing okay.</p>\n<p>So far, my team consists of 2 other guys, with me being split 80/20 as software engineer and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_manager\">project manager</a>. One guy came from finance startups, as a data analyst and QA (?), who learned how to program with the help of coding bootcamps. The other guy was previously an elementary school teacher, who also went through a bootcamp; this would be his first job as a Software Engineer. For everyone involved, this team has been a cool learning experience.</p>\n<p>The application that we’re working on is the start to a “Supplier Ecosystem” that the company is trying to build (or rebuild?). It’s to help onboard suppliers who are trying to sell their products either on the online store or in physical stores. Currently, the process to onboard these people is time-consuming, email-centric, and not very centralized. It’s worth mentioning that our application introduces new measurements and data that was not able to be done before. It must be nice having the resources to create new data-driven processes and new metrics. Companies have it so great.</p>\n<p>As the experienced one of the team, I know the ins and outs of the services we use, and the tooling needed to deploy a new application. I’ve been the guide for most of the processes by sharing how we do things around the company. In the process of teaching, I noticed that I like sharing ideas on the white board a lot, but I’ve also been careful not to overdo it. I’m also the go-to in terms of automating GitHub Pull Request checks with <a href=\"https://jenkins.io/\">Jenkins</a>, and creating automated builds with deployments to our different environments given our git flows. The industry calls that ”<a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment\">CI/CD</a>”, but I barely care to remember which is which.</p>\n<p>To keep us engineers happy, we also get to use the latest version of <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>, v16.8; we get to try out CSS in JS with <a href=\"https://emotion.sh/\">Emotion</a>, which was inspired by <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\">Styled Components</a>; we <em>finally</em> get to use <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> for unit testing, along with its snapshots feature; and finally, we get to use <a href=\"https://graphql.org/\">GraphQL</a> in our Node layer. I have yet to set up a <a href=\"https://hapijs.com/\">Hapi</a> endpoint that supports GraphQL, and I’m curious to see if GraphQL is even supported by <a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a>. I know it’s a google search away, but I haven’t even done that yet. I’ve been busy.</p>","frontmatter":{"author":"Kevin","categories":["#work","#management","#programming","#tech","#tools"],"date":"April 23, 2019 02:03","path":"/work/team-lead","title":"On being a new team lead"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/work/team-lead/"}}
