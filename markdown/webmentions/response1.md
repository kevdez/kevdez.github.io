 <div class="p-name p-content"><br />Is this the correct way to respond? I'll probably delete this page later. I need a way to dedicate my responses to a certain part of the site. I'm also in the process of being able to use .mdx instead of .md so that I can use React within my markdown. Ideally, a component that handles and styles webmentions would be cool.</div>
