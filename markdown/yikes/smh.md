# Hello!

**hello** is this thing on?

This page was generated with [Markdown](https://markdown-it.github.io/). So as you can see, I'm testing things.

# _Hello_

Do images work?

This is a horrendous blog post.

Yes, I am learning Gatsby and Markdown. ðŸ˜…

To test color coding from [PrismJS](https://prismjs.com/), here is some JavaScript code:

```javascript
const x = `hi ${world}`;
console.log(x);
```

Here is some C++ :

```c
include <stdio.h>;

int main() {
  return 0;
}
```

Okay, so this is cool. Thanks for reading! Stay tuned for more posts I guess. I'll delete this later. :)
